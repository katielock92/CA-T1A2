# Katie's Portfolio Website *(Coder Academy Term 1 Assignment 2)*

### **About**
The purpose of this website is establish a portfolio for myself (Katie Lock) as a new web developer. This website will not only list and demonstrate the skills that I have learnt so far (both within my Coder Academy bootcamp along with prior learning), but also give the user an understanding of my personality and experience outside of coding.

The expected user of my website would be recruiters and/or hiring managers for entry-level web development/engineering roles - who either are proactively seeking out candidates, or have viewed an application that I have placed for an advertised role.

### **Functionality and Features**
The key functionality and features of my portfolio website are:
- multiple pages linked from a nav bar on the main home page, including:
    - **portfolio** - a demonstration of my coding work so far *(with placeholders to add future work)*
    - **about me** - more about who I am, my background and experience prior to coding, along with my hobbies and interests
    - **blog** - a place where I can write posts about topics that I am passionate about, and/or share my learnings so far in this course *(can include placehodlers for future posts)*
    - **contact** - a way that recruiters can contact me
- designed with a **mobile first** approach, using multiple break points to have suitable adapted layouts for various screen sizes
- designed with **accessibility** at front of mind:
    - a simplistic layout that does not cause sensory overload
    - alt text on all visual elements
    - colours palette designed to have meaning, even for those who are colour blind
    - semantic elements used when building layout

As I had already developed a similar website for my Diversity in Tech scholarship application, I have linked to the original website from my portfolio to demonstrate my growth since beginning this course.
